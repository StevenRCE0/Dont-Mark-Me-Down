# Dont-Mark-Me-Down

## ðŸš§ No, it does not work at the moment and needs loads of work. ðŸš§

It's not a markdown parser, but a JSX-like HTML parser for writers. 
The purpose of this project is to make something with zero-effort to parse and render, and play nicely with web technologies like CSS and JavaScript, with highly customizable extensions and options. 
Which is ideal for blogging. 

**Text should look like:**
```
h1  Don't Mark Me Down

It's not a markdown parser, but a JSX-like HTML parser for writers. 

Here are the benefits:

ul
  blah
  blah

Thanks.
